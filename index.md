# **About**

I am a first-year PhD student in the [PLSE Lab](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering) at [School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/), [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/), **[Georgia Institute of Technology (GT)](https://www.gatech.edu/)**. 

My research experience lies in ***Programming Languages (PL)*** and ***Formal Methods***. PhD program is a brand new stage of my life. I'm still exploring the various researches in PL.

During my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) ,  I was advised by **[Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html)** and worked on *compiler correctness* and *Modal Logic* in *Coq proof assistant* from junior to senior year . Prior to that I studied in **[Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)** group and worked on Automata Theory (specifically, *supervisory control* of *Discrete Event System*) during sophomore year. They are the persons who taught me a huge number of things during undergraduate life and gave me a great start of research life.

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research Projects**

### During PhD program

To be updated soon (or maybe a year later)





### During Undergraduate Time

- [2020~2021] **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization** 
  - I proposed a frame verification work based on *proof assistant Coq* and gave a trial on "toy logic" for an expedition to support compiler optimization aided by verification information carried by programs 
  - This project was now continued by  [Hanzhi Liu](https://misaka.center/), an undergraduate genius student (2019~2023, expected) and an experienced programmer at SJTU, also advised by Qinxiang Cao, to implement this optimization and framework in VST's separation logic [VST = Verified Software Toolchain]
  - Further detail should be secret now
- [2019~2020] **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.
- [2018~2019] **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.
  - 





# **Publication**

# **Projects for Courses/Fun**

The following projects are selected either from course work or my entertainment during spare time:

- [**SimPL Interpreter**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/SimPL-Interpreter): an interpreter for a simple programming language called *SimPL*, implemented in **2020**.

  (My first practical project for real life; it also helped my learn Java programming languages for the first time)

- [**Re-implementation of *deque* and *map* of  C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**:](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Re-implementation-of-deque-and-map) Re-implement the data structure *deque* (using Block List) and *map* (using AVL Tree) of C++ Standard Library, simulating most of their original designed functions, implemented in **2018**. 

  (My first course project of computer science)

## Other Facts

#### Jokes

- I usually mix up with "sophomore" and "semaphore" 



#### Computer Science

- I was also admitted by the *Master of Logic* program at the University of Amsterdam. But not rich enough to enroll : ( 
- I have no industrial experience till now. I still regard myself as a nonprofessional programmer...
- Unlike a lot of my friends that started learning programming at a very young age, I never stepped into it until freshman year at SJTU.
- I gave up a desire of stepping into game design, another totally different career life at sophomore. This is mainly because I didn't found neither a good mentor/advisor nor suitable partners and didn't make it by self-study. Nevertheless, I did in the area of Programming Languages later! But I always love the world of video games.



#### Life

- I was born and raised up in Chongqing, China. This is a magical city built on several mountains. You should pay a visit if you'd like to see how such thing could exist. My father comes from Hebei Province in China and worked there in a city named Zhuozhou close to Beijing for a very long time. Therefore, I was also familiar with this two cities. 
- Although I lived in Shanghai for 4 years during my undergraduate life, I know nothing about Shanghai at all because I spend most of my time on campus : (
- 4...
