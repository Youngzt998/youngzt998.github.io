# **About**

I am a first-year PhD student in the [PLSE Lab](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering) at [School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/), [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/), **[Georgia Institute of Technology (GT)](https://www.gatech.edu/)**. 

My research experience lies in ***Programming Languages (PL)*** and ***Formal Methods***. PhD program is a brand new stage of my life. I'm still exploring the various researches in PL.

During my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) ,  I was advised by **[Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html)** and worked on *compiler correctness* and *Modal Logic* in *Coq proof assistant* from junior to senior year . Prior to that I studied in **[Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)** group and worked on Automata Theory (specifically, *supervisory control* of *Discrete Event System*) during sophomore year. They are the persons who taught me a huge number of things during undergraduate life and gave me a great start of research life.

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research Projects**

**During PhD Program**

To be updated soon (or maybe a year later)



<u>I will probably investigate a subset of researches around those general topics in the following one or two years</u>:

- Graph reachability problems and their application with static analysis;
- Program synthesis and computability problems related to them;
- Software testing (generally);
- Combining static analysis and formal verification;
- Program verification for concurrent program;

*If you found that we shared similar interests, I'd be excited to have a free discuss with you!*



<u>I will probably also be learning the fundamental knowledges of those topics in the following one or two years</u>:

- Computability
- Separation Logic (meta-theory and application), 
- Meta-theory of Coq proof assistant, i.e. *Calculus of Constructions*
- Basic knowledge of type theory
- LLVM



**During Undergraduate Time**

- [2020~2021] **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization** 
  - I proposed a frame verification work based on *proof assistant Coq* and gave a trial on "toy logic" for an expedition to support compiler optimization aided by verification information carried by programs 
  - This project was now continued by  [Hanzhi Liu](https://misaka.center/), an undergraduate genius student (2019~2023, expected) and an experienced programmer at SJTU, also advised by Qinxiang Cao, to implement this optimization and framework in VST's separation logic [VST = Verified Software Toolchain]
  - Further detail should be secret now
- [2019~2020] **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.
- [2018~2019] **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.
  - 





# **Publication**

## **Some Cyber-friends :)**

- I am fortunate to know [Ziteng Wang](https://wzt.me/), who share the same spell of first name, similar spell of last name, and most importantly, the research interests in Programming Languages with me.
- I shared a similar game interest with [Zhiming Xu](https://zhiming-xu.github.io/), although we seem not to share similar research interests
- [Alex Chi](https://www.skyzh.dev/) is an undergraduate student (graduate at 2022)  from the department of Computer Science at SJTU; you might be interested in his (famous, somehow) programming skills and (famous, somehow) course grades
- [xxchan](https://xxchan.github.io/about/) used to be in the same research group with me during undergraduate time. His experience (see [this blog](https://xxchan.github.io/cs/2020/09/02/intern-at-meituan.html)) in an company might be a great reference for those (in China) who are still not sure whether going academical or industrial.  





## **Cooking**

To be updated when I became a master of that ...



# **Share Some Facts**

## "The Joke's On Me" - **Jokes in My Real Life**

- I usually mix up with "sophomore" and "semaphore" (This happens for at least 5 times ...)
- The first day I arrived at my undergraduate college, I need to configure the internet in my dormitory. Since I had never got in touch any concept about computer system yet, when they asked me to provide the MAC address, I mistook for that I must have a *Mac* from apple to earn the accessibility to the Internet.

## **Jokes/Meme in Computer Science (from internet)**

- "WHAT IS YOUR ADDRESS"

## **Computer Science in My Life**

- I was also admitted by the *Master of Logic* program at the University of Amsterdam. But not rich enough to enroll : (  [It requires around 10,000 for tuition and another 10,000 or maybe more for life expenses ...]
  - It doesn't mean I do not love Computer Science; they are somehow *[mutually inductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_type#Mutually_inductive_definitions)* magics of the world 
- I gave up the desire of stepping into game design, another totally different career life at sophomore. This is mainly because I didn't found neither a good mentor/advisor nor ideal partners and didn't make it by self-study.
  - It doesn't mean I do not love Programming Languages. Instead, I found those two things in the area of Programming Languages later! 
  - Nevertheless, I always love the world of video games and believe they are a treasure of humans.
- I have no industrial experience till now. I still regard myself as **a very nonprofessional programmer**...
- Unlike a lot of my friends that started learning programming at a very young age, I never touched the world of computer science until freshman year at SJTU.



## Life

- I was born and raised up in *Chongqing*, China. This is a magical city built on several mountains. You should pay a visit if you'd like to see how such thing could exist. Besides, my father comes from *Hebei* Province in China and worked there in a small city named *Zhuozhou* for a very long time, which is only 1-hour-drive to *Beijing* . Therefore, I was also familiar with those cities. 
- Although I lived in Shanghai for 4 years during my undergraduate life, I know nothing about Shanghai at all because I spend most of my time on campus : (  The fact is, you will spend even less (a half) time to go to the downtown area in Shanghai from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province than going there from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
