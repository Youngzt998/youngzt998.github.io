# **About**

I'm currently a senior year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/). 

My research interests currently lies in formal methods, especially formal verification  and formalization of mathematical theorems. As an undergraduate students, I'm exploring more amazing research fields. I was advised by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html) at present, before which I studied in [Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/) group.

I wish I could devote myself to the research and education of computer science in the future, so I am seeking a place to pursue Ph. D. degree.

Here is my [CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang_EN.pdf).

# **Research Projects**

**Currently：**

- **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization**

  We implement a new method of program optimization for C programs with annotation that contains the verification information of the program.  A conditional definition of "forward simulation" and "backward simulation"  for compile correctness was proposed with crucial properties proved formally in Coq. The new methods was being realized based on [CompCert](http://compcert.inria.fr/) compiler. We also implemented a translation path from annotated CompCert C source language to annotated RTL intermediate language. Further details are confidential.

- **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**

  [UnifySL](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) is a library of the proof assistant [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) for logic under development (not open sourced for now). Formalized proof theories, semantic definitions, soundness proofs and completeness proofs of minimum logics, propositional logics and separation logics were realized using Coq's type classes and high-order features. The completeness proof of previous logics are all based on the framework of infinite canonical model.

  My work aimed to investigate the finite model methods, starting from the formalizing of propositional dynamic logic (PDL), including the proof theories, semantic definitions, the proof of its soundness and  the proof of its weak completeness, making the best of framework and tools in UnifySL. Currently the completeness proof was finished, and we are extracting a new framework of high-order abstraction for finite model methods. 

  During my work, a lot of useful lemmas was also proved as a supplementary of the UnifySL library. 



**Previously:**

- **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems** 

  The supervisory control theory of Discrete Event Systems (DES) is a formal framework for the synthesis of control logic for complex automated systems. We investigate the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event. The design objective is to synthesize a maximally-permissive supervisor to restrict the behavior of the system such that the closed-loop language is within a safe specification language. Relevant paper was accepted by [IFAC2020](https://www.ifac2020.org/),  see Publications.
  We also hope to investigate the non-blocking problem employing nondeterministic control method in the future.
