# **About**

I am a first-year PhD in the [PLSE Lab](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering) at School of Computer Science, <u>**Georgia Institute of Technology**</u>. 

My current research experience lies in *Programming Languages* and *Formal Methods*.

During my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) ,  I was advised by **[Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html)** and worked on *compiler correctness* and *Modal Logic* in *Coq proof assistant* from junior to senior year . Prior to that I studied in **[Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)** group and worked on Automata Theory (specifically, *supervisory control* of *Discrete Event System*) during sophomore year. They are the persons who taught me a huge number of things during undergraduate life and gave me a great start of research life.

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research Projects**









### During Undergraduate Time

- **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization**
  - I proposed a frame verification work and gave a trial on "toy logic" for an expedition to support compiler optimization aided by verification information carried by programs 
  - This project was now continued by  [Hanzhi Liu](https://misaka.center/), an undergraduate student (2019~2023, expected) at SJTU, also advised by Qinxiang Cao to implement this optimization and framework in VST's separation logic [VST = Verified Software Toolchain]
  - Further detail should be secret now

- **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.

- **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.





# **Publication**



### During Undergraduate Time

**Conference Paper:**

- **Ziteng Yang**, X. Yin and S. Li. “Maximally permissive supervisor control of timed discrete-event systems under partial observation,” in 21st IFAC World Congress, 2020.  

  [ [PDF](./papers/IFAC2020/IFAC2020-Final-Full.pdf)  l  [Slide](./papers/IFAC2020/IFAC2020-Slides.pdf) l  [Video Report (Youtube)](https://youtu.be/GtbxR_OKfXU) ]. 





# **Teaching Experience**

# **Projects for Courses/Fun**

The following projects are selected either from course work or my entertainment during spare time:

- [**SimPL Interpreter**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/SimPL-Interpreter): an interpreter for a simple programming language called *SimPL*, implemented in **2020**.

- [**Naive-Airdrop**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Naive-Airdrop): an application for encrypted file synchronization between PC and Android under the same wi-fi, implemented in **2019**.  

  (Both my first project using Java and first practical project for real life.)

- [**Re-implementation of *deque* and *map* of  C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**:](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Re-implementation-of-deque-and-map) Re-implement the data structure *deque* (using Block List) and *map* (using AVL Tree) of C++ Standard Library, simulating most of their original designed functions, implemented in **2018**. 

  (My first project of programming.)

## Other Facts

- I was born and raised up in Chongqing, China. This is a magical city built on several mountains. You should pay a visit if you'd like to see how such thing could exist. My father comes from Hebei Province in China and worked there in a city named Zhuozhou close to Beijing for a very long time. Therefore, I was also familiar with this two cities. 
- Although I lived in Shanghai for 4 years during my undergraduate life, I know nothing about Shanghai at all because I spend most of my time on campus : (
