# **About**

I'm currently a senior year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/). 

My current research experience lies in *programming languages* and *formal methods*, especially using them to solve practical problems (i.e. building reliable system) and formalization of mathematical theorems. I also have research experience in *Automata Theory*.  

As an undergraduate students, I'm exploring more amazing research fields. I was advised by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html) at present, before which I studied in [Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/) group. I wish I could devote myself to the research and education of computer science in the future, so I am seeking a place to pursue Ph. D. degree.

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research Projects**

The following lists my most important research experience during undergraduate study.  

See more details in [Projects](/project/) .

**Currently：**

- **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization**: An expedition to support compiler optimization aided by verification information carried by programs 

- **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.

**Previously:**

- **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.

  

# **Publication**

**Conference Paper:**

- **Ziteng Yang**, X. Yin and S. Li. “Maximally permissive supervisor control of timed discrete-event systems under partial observation,” in 21st IFAC World Congress, 2020.

# **Other Projects**

The following projects are selected either from course work or my entertainment during spare time:

- [**SimPL Interpreter**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/SimPL-Interpreter): an interpreter for a simple programming language called *SimPL*, implemented in **2020**.

- [**Naive-Airdrop**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Naive-Airdrop): an application for encrypted file synchronization between PC and Android under the same wi-fi, implemented in **2019**.  

  (Both my first project using Java and first practical project for real life.)

- [**Linux (Android) Memory Management**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Operating-System-Projects/blob/master/2/Report-as-an-Instruction.pdf): Replacement of the original page replacement algorithm with a new one in a given specification, implemented in **2019**.

- [**In The Garden**](https://youtu.be/2D67W584gpU): a mini puzzle game (Chinese version only), created in **2018**, with other two partner. 

  (My first mini-project of game design.)

- [**Re-implementation of *deque* and *map* of  C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**:](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Re-implementation-of-deque-and-map) Re-implement the data structure *deque* (using Block List) and *map* (using AVL Tree) of C++ Standard Library, simulating most of their original designed functions, implemented in **2018**. 

  (My first project of programming.)
