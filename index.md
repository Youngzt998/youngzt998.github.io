# **About**

I'm currently a senior year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), major in Computer Science and Technology. 

My research interests currently lies in formal methods, especially formal verification  and formalization of mathematical theorems. As an undergraduate students, I'm still learning about more amazing research fields. I was advised by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html) at present, before which I studied in [Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/) group.

I wish I could devote myself to the research and education of computer science in the future.
