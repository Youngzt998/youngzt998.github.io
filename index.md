# **About**

I'm currently a senior year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), major in Computer Science and Technology. 

My research interests currently lies in formal methods, especially formal verification  and formalization of mathematical theorems. As an undergraduate students, I'm learning about more amazing research fields. I was advised by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html) at present, before which I studied in [Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/) group.

I wish I could devote myself to the research and education of computer science in the future.

See details in [Projects](/project/) .



# **Publication**

- **Ziteng Yang**, X. Yin and S. Li. “Maximally permissive supervisor control of timed discrete-event systems under partial observation,” in 21st IFAC World Congress, 2020. [[PDF](./papers/IFAC2020-Final.pdf)(proof of lemmas are removed after acceptance owing to word limit)]. 



# **Other Projects** (Nonacademic)



- **SimPL Interpreter**: an interpreter for a simple programming language called *SimPL*, implemented in 2020.
- **Naive-Airdrop**: a safe application for file synchronization between PC and Android, implemented in 2019. (My first project using Java.)
- **In The Garden**: a mini puzzle game (Chinese version only), created in 2018. (My first mini-project for game design.)
- **Re-implementation of deque and map in STL**: Re-implement the data structure *deque* (using Block List) and *map* (using AVL Tree) of C++ Standard Library, simulating most of their original designed functions, implemented in 2018.
