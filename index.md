# **About**

I am a first-year PhD in the [PLSE Lab](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering) at School of Computer Science, **Georgia Institute of Technology**. 

My current research experience lies in *Programming Languages* and *Formal Methods*.

During my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) ,  I was advised by **[Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html)** and worked on *compiler correctness* and *Modal Logic* in *Coq proof assistant* from junior to senior year . Prior to that I studied in **[Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)** group and worked on Automata Theory (specifically, *supervisory control* of *Discrete Event System*) during sophomore year. They are the persons who taught me a huge number of things during undergraduate life and gave me a great start of research life.

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research Projects**

The following lists my most important research experiences during undergraduate study.  

See more details in [Projects](/project/) .



**Previously:**

- **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization**
  - I proposed a frame verification work and gave a trial on "toy logic" for an expedition to support compiler optimization aided by verification information carried by programs 
  - This project was now continued by  [Hanzhi Liu](https://misaka.center/), an undergraduate student at SJTU, also advised by Qinxiang Cao) to implement this optimization and framework in VST's separation logic [VST = Verified Software Toolchain]
  - Further detail should be secret now

- **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.

- **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.

  

# **Publication**

**Conference Paper:**

- **Ziteng Yang**, X. Yin and S. Li. “Maximally permissive supervisor control of timed discrete-event systems under partial observation,” in 21st IFAC World Congress, 2020.

# **Teaching Experience**

- **Teaching Assistant **  for *MA208@SJTU: Discrete Mathematics*, 2020 fall, lectured by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html) .
  - Courses for the *IEEE Honor Class (an honor class for elite students in EECS) at SJTU & Artificial Intelligence Class * 
  - Duties: Q&A, making  answer sheets for exercises
- **Teaching Assistant for  *MA239@SJTU: Discrete Mathematics (Honor)*, 2020 fall, lectured by [Xiang Yin](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/).
  - Courses for the  *[Zhiyuan Honor Program](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/index.php) (a program only for top 5% students in Engineering related majors) at SJTU*;
  - Duties: exercise grading, tutorials (for exercises) teaching, office hours holding and Q&A



# **Projects for Courses/Fun**

The following projects are selected either from course work or my entertainment during spare time:

- [**SimPL Interpreter**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/SimPL-Interpreter): an interpreter for a simple programming language called *SimPL*, implemented in **2020**.

- [**Naive-Airdrop**](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Naive-Airdrop): an application for encrypted file synchronization between PC and Android under the same wi-fi, implemented in **2019**.  

  (Both my first project using Java and first practical project for real life.)

- [**Re-implementation of *deque* and *map* of  C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**:](https://github.com/Youngzt998/Re-implementation-of-deque-and-map) Re-implement the data structure *deque* (using Block List) and *map* (using AVL Tree) of C++ Standard Library, simulating most of their original designed functions, implemented in **2018**. 

  (My first project of programming.)

## Other Facts

- I was born and raised up in Chongqin, China. This is a magical city built on several mountains. You should pay a visit if you'd like to see a different city. My father comes from Heibei Province in China and worked there in a city named Zhuozhou close to Beijing for a very long time. Therefore, I was also familiar with this two cities.
