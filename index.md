# **About**

I'm currently a senior year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), major in Computer Science and Technology. 

My research interests currently lies in formal methods, especially formal verification  and formalization of mathematical theorems. As an undergraduate students, I'm learning about more amazing research fields. I was advised by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html) at present, before which I studied in [Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/) group.

I wish I could devote myself to the research and education of computer science in the future.



# **Research Projects**

**Currently：**

- **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization**
- **Formalization of Completeness Proof of Propositional Dynamic Logic in Coq**



**Previously:**

- **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**



See details in [Projects](/project/) .



# **Publication**

- **Ziteng Yang**, X. Yin and S. Li. “Maximally permissive supervisor control of timed discrete-event systems under partial observation,” in 21st IFAC World Congress, 2020.  [ [PDF](./papers/IFAC2020/IFAC2020-Final.pdf)  l  [Slide](./papers/IFAC2020/IFAC2020-Slides.pdf) l  [Video Report](./papers/IFAC2020/IFAC2020-Video.zip) ]. 

  (The proofs of all lemmas and theorems are removed after acceptance owing to word limit. Contact me to require the full version if interested.)



# **Teaching Experience**

- Teaching Assistant for  *MA239@SJTU: Discrete Mathematics (Honor)*, 2020 Fall, lectured by [Xiang Yin](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/).







# **Other Projects** (Nonacademic)

The following projects are selected either from course work or my entertainment during spare time:

- **SimPL Interpreter**: an interpreter for a simple programming language called *SimPL*, implemented in 2020.

- **Naive-Airdrop**: an application for encrypted file synchronization between PC and Android under the same wi-fi, implemented in 2019.  

  (Both my first project using Java and first practical project for real life.)

- **In The Garden**: a mini puzzle game (Chinese version only), created in 2018, with other two partner. 

  (My first mini-project of game design.)

- **Re-implementation of *deque* and *map* of  C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**: Re-implement the data structure *deque* (using Block List) and *map* (using AVL Tree) of C++ Standard Library, simulating most of their original designed functions, implemented in 2018. 

  (My first project of programming.)
