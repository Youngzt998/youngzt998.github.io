# **About**

I am a first-year PhD student in the [PLSE Lab](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering) at [School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/), [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/), **[Georgia Institute of Technology (GT)](https://www.gatech.edu/)**. 

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Biography**

My research interests lies in ***Programming Languages (PL)*** and ***Formal Methods***. PhD program is a brand new stage of my life. I'm still exploring the various research areas in PL.

During my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) ,  I was advised by **[Qinxiang Cao](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/qinxiang-cao.html)** and worked on *compiler correctness* and *mathematical logic* in the *Coq proof assistant* from junior to senior year . Prior to that I studied in **[Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)** group and worked on Automata Theory (specifically, *supervisory control* of *Discrete Event System*) during sophomore year. They are the persons who taught me a huge number of things during undergraduate life and gave me a great start of research life.





# **Research Projects**

**During PhD Time**

<u>I will probably investigate a subset of researches around those general topics in the following one or two years</u>:

- **[actively working on]** Graph reachability problems and their application with static analysis;
- **[actively working on]** Program analysis for parallel programs ;
- Combining static analysis and formal verification;
  - Formally verified static analysis
  - Static analysis with extra information from formal verification 
- Program verification for concurrent program;



**During Undergraduate Time**

- [2020~2021] **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization** 
  - This is an expedition to support compiler optimization aided by verification information carried by programs;
  - I proposed a verification framework based on *proof assistant Coq* and gave a trial on "toy logic" ;
  - This project was now continued by  [Hanzhi Liu](https://misaka.center/) to implement this optimization and framework in VST's Separation Logic [VST := Verified Software Toolchain]; further detail should be secret now; there should be a paper submission soon
- [2019~2020] **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.
- [2018~2019] **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.
