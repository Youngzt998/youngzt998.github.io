# **About & Biography** 

I am a PhD student in the [PLSE Lab](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering) at **[Georgia Institute of Technology (GT)](https://www.gatech.edu/)** since 2021, advised by Prof. [**Vivek Sarkar**](https://vsarkar.cc.gatech.edu/). My current research area are ***Programming Languages (PL)*** , specifically, **program logic & verification**, **parallelism&concurrency**, and their application in compiler. 

Before joining Georgia Tech, I spent my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/).  I worked as a research assistant advised by **[Qinxiang Cao](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/qinxiang-cao.html)** and worked on ***compiler correctness*** and ***mathematical logic*** in the ***Coq proof assistant*** from junior to senior year. Prior to that I studied in **[Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)** group and worked on **Automata Theory** (specifically, *supervisory control* of *Discrete Event System*) during sophomore year.

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research**

**Currently**

- **Program Logic & Certified Compilation** (e.g. improving CompCert)
- **Parallelism & Concurrency** (e.g. verification of parallelizing compilers, prediction of data-race)

**During Undergraduate Time**

- [Compiler Verification] **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization**: 
  
  An expedition to support certified compiler optimization aided by verification information as a hint carried by programs. I proposed a verification framework based on *proof assistant Coq* and gave a trial on "toy logic". This project was now continued by [Hanzhi Liu](https://misaka.center/) to implement this optimization and framework in VST's Separation Logic [VST := Verified Software Toolchain]; 
  
- [Proof Assistant & Mathematical Logic] **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.

- [Formal Control Theory] **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.
