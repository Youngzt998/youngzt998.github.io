***This is the site only for fun! It's not really so related to researches... However, it shows 30% of my personality : ) *** 



## **Sentences I wish to share**

[Inside Chinese internet, we some times called it "chicken soup" if some sentence or story is heuristic]

- *"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."* --- Linus Torvalds

- *"Talk is cheap. Show me the proof."* --- Qinxiang Cao

- *"Talk is not cheap"* --- Some Cyber-stranger

- *“闻道有先后，术业有专攻”*  --- 韩愈

  One might have learned the doctrine earlier than the other, or might be a master in his own special field. --- [Yu Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Yu)

- [Russell's Message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaB8AFOhZo):

  - <iframe width="280" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihaB8AFOhZo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  - "*Ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out*"

  - "*Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but look only and solely at what are the facts.*"

  - "*Love is wise, hatred is foolish.*"

  

## **Current Future Plans**

- Learn more things in Computer Science (especially in **PL**, **Theory** and **System**), **Logics**, and **Mathematics**
- Probably learn some music instruments and theory - wish I have such time ...
- ~~Raise a cat in 2 years~~ Raise another cat in 2 years : )  



## **Some Cyber-friends :)**

- I am fortunate to know [Ziteng Wang](https://wzt.me/), who share the same spell of first name, similar spell of last name, and most importantly, the research interests in Programming Languages with me.
- I shared a similar game interest with [Zhiming Xu](https://zhiming-xu.github.io/), although we seem not to share similar research interests
- [Alex Chi](https://www.skyzh.dev/) is an undergraduate student (graduate at 2022)  from the department of Computer Science at SJTU; you might be interested in his (famous, somehow) programming skills and (famous, somehow) course grades
- [xxchan](https://xxchan.github.io/about/) used to be in the same research group with me during undergraduate time. His experience (see [this blog](https://xxchan.github.io/cs/2020/09/02/intern-at-meituan.html)) in an company might be a great reference for those (in China) who are still not sure whether going academical or industrial.  







## **Computer Science in My Life**

- I was also admitted by the *Master of Logic* program at the University of Amsterdam. But not rich enough to enroll : (  [It requires around £10,000 for tuition and another £10,000 or maybe more for life expenses ...]
  - It doesn't mean I do not love Computer Science; they are somehow *[mutually inductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_type#Mutually_inductive_definitions)* magics of the world 
- I gave up the desire of stepping into game design, another totally different career life at sophomore. This is mainly because I didn't found neither a good mentor/advisor nor ideal partners and didn't make it by self-study.
  - It doesn't mean I do not love Programming Languages. Instead, I found those two things in the area of Programming Languages later! 
  - Nevertheless, I always love the world of video games and believe they are a treasure of humans.
- I have no industrial experience till now. I still regard myself as **a very nonprofessional programmer**...
- Unlike a lot of my friends that started learning programming at a very young age, I never touched the world of computer science until freshman year at SJTU.



## **Life**

- I was born and raised up in *Chongqing*, China. This is a magical city built on several mountains. You should pay a visit if you'd like to see how such thing could exist. Besides, my father comes from *Hebei* Province in China and worked there in a small city named *Zhuozhou* for a very long time, which is only 1-hour-drive to *Beijing* . Therefore, I was also familiar with those cities. 
- Although I lived in Shanghai for 4 years during my undergraduate life, I know nothing about Shanghai at all because I spend most of my time on campus : (  The fact is, you will spend even less (a half) time to go to the downtown area in Shanghai from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province than going there from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

## **Cooking**

To be updated when I became a master of that ...



# **Share Some Facts**

## "The Joke's On Me" - **Jokes in My Real Life**

- I usually mix up with "sophomore" and "semaphore" (This happens for at least 5 times ...)
- The first day I arrived at my undergraduate college, I need to configure the internet in my dormitory. Since I had never got in touch any concept about computer system yet, when they asked me to provide the MAC address, I mistook for that I must have a *Mac* from apple to earn the accessibility to the Internet.
  - However, this is a good lesson for what CS related people should concern when talking about concepts with non-CS people...
